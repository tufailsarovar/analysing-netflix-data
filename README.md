A data cleaning and preprocessing project focused on preparing the Netflix dataset for analysis using **Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook**.

This project demonstrates real-world data cleaning workflows including handling missing values, fixing mixed data types, and transforming raw data into analysis-ready datasets.

---

## Project Overview

Raw datasets are rarely clean.  
This project focuses on transforming messy Netflix content data into a structured and usable format suitable for analytics and visualization.

Key objectives:

- Identify and handle missing values  
- Fix inconsistent/mixed-type columns  
- Convert date columns into datetime format  
- Create derived analytical features  
- Prepare clean dataset for further analysis

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Cleaning Steps Performed

### 1️Missing Values Handling

- Filled categorical columns using **"Unknown"** or **mode values**
- Verified null counts **column-wise**
- Ensured dataset consistency after imputation

---

### Mixed-Type Column Fix

- Cleaned the `duration` column by splitting into:
  - **Numeric duration value**
  - **Duration type** (Minutes / Seasons)
- Standardized data types for analysis readiness

---

### Datetime Conversion

- Converted `date_added` into proper **datetime format**
- Extracted new analytical features:
  - `year_added`
  - `month_added`
  - `month_name`

---

### Data Validation

- Verified column datatypes
- Removed inconsistencies and formatting issues
- Saved a fully cleaned dataset for downstream analysis

---

## Output

A cleaned and structured dataset ready for:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Dashboard Creation
- Business Insights

---

## Project Source

This project is inspired by the learning project from **roadmap.sh**:

</> <https://roadmap.sh/projects/cleaning-netflix-dataset>

Implementation and analysis were completed **independently** as part of learning real-world data analytics workflows.

---

## Future Improvements

- Content trend analysis
- Genre popularity insights
- Dashboard using **Power BI / Tableau**
- Time-series visualization

---

## Learning Outcome

This project strengthened understanding of:

- Real-world data preprocessing
- Pandas data transformation
- Analytical thinking
- Structuring analytics projects for GitHub portfolios
